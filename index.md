_Discover the beauty of mathematics through the lens of category theory with this unique exploration that goes beyond problem-solving. In this book, you'll find a refreshing perspective on math as an art form, a language, and a way of thinking that unifies diverse fields of knowledge. Delve into the fascinating world of sets, groups, types, and partial orders, and explore the deep connections between these concepts. Whether you're a curious beginner or a seasoned mathematician, this book offers clear explanations, diagrams, and engaging insights—it's a journey into the heart of mathematics for everyone._

> Category Theory Illustrated is the best introduction to Category Theory I’ve ever seen. It is highly visual, full of useful examples and is extremely clearly written. I highly recommend giving it a try.

> The range of applications for category theory is immense, and visually conveying meaning through illustration is an indispensable skill for organizational and technical work. Unfortunately, the foundations of category theory, despite much of their utility and simplicity being on par with Venn Diagrams, are locked behind resources that assume far too much academic background.

>Should category theory be considered for this academic purpose or any work wherein clear thinking and explanations are valued, beginner-appropriate resources are essential. There is no book on category theory that makes its abstractions so tangible as "Category Theory Illustrated" does. I recommend it for programmers, managers, organizers, designers, or anyone else who values the structure and clarity of information, processes, and relationships.

> The clarity, consistency and elegance of diagrams in 'Category Theory Illustrated' has helped us demystify and explain in simple terms a topic often feared.

I want to make this book into the best introductory text, not only to category theory, but to mathematics as a whole. It seems that I would need some help, though.

- I am looking for a *publisher* who is willing to work release this book. You can contact me via [email](mailto:marinovboris@protonmail.com)

- I am also looking for co-authors and/or technical reviewers, who are willing to help with polishing and enriching the text. Post an issue or PR on [Github](https://github.com/abuseofnotation/category-theory-illustrated). 

- And if you want to get the whole version of the book as a pdf or an epub, as well as a lot of additional perks, support me on [Patreon](https://patreon.com/abuseofnotation) or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/abuseofnotation).

_Thanks to my regular supporters: Artiom Kasapu, Meme Gawd, Al King_
